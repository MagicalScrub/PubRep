This repository contains different files that may contain link to free 3d models.

I do not own, I have not created, and I have not modified ANY of the 3d models and mp3 audios.

The 3d models, beside from the sources below, are stored in the other public repository RepoProof at the following link: https://github.com/MagicalScrub/PubRep
